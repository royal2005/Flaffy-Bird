# Flappy Bird

## Overview
Welcome to Flappy Bird! This project utilizes the pygame and neat libraries to create a game where AI agents play for you and enhance their performance in each session, also known as generations.

## Agents
The improvement of agents is driven by a reinforcement learning algorithm integrated into the neat library. For a better understanding of the algorithm and the math, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf).
