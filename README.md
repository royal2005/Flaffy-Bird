# Flappy Bird

## Overview
Welcome to Flappy Bird! This project utilizes the pygame and neat libraries to create a game where AI agents enhance their performance in each session, also known as generations.

## Agents
The improvement of agents is driven by a reinforcement learning algorithm integrated into the neat library. To gain a deeper understanding of the algorithm, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/neat_overview.html).
